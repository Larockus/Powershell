# Powershell
A collection of PS scripts that I use for various tasks. 

## idleDomainMachines.ps1:
Searches the domain for computers that have not connected in X amount of days. The script presents the user with options in powershell to choose the # of days, and if the file should be saved locally.  
### NOTE
*Locally saved files are saved in the directory the script is ran from.*

## computerLastUser.ps1
Searches for the last user to log into a domain computer. 

## CheckUserServices.ps1
Searches specific remote domain machines for all currently running services
